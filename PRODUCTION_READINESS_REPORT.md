## 🎯 What's Intentionally Left for Later

These items are documented and planned for intern training:

### Unit Test Coverage
- Entity tests (partial - 4 files)
- Service layer tests (partial - 1 file)
- Integration tests (future)
- E2E tests (future)
- Coverage reporting (future)

**Rationale**: Core functionality works. Tests are valuable but not blocking production deployment. Perfect learning opportunity for interns.
