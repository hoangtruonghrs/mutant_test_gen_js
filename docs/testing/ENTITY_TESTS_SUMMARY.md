## 🎓 Technical Highlights

### Mock System Design
Our mock adapters are:
- **Configurable**: Support custom responses and failures
- **Trackable**: Record all calls with timestamps
- **Resettable**: Clean state between tests
- **Realistic**: Mirror real adapter behavior

### Test Helpers
Utility functions for:
- Temporary file/directory management
- Console output capturing
- Async error assertions
- Spy function creation
- Deep object cloning

### Fixture Data
Comprehensive samples including:
- Source code (calculator, user manager)
- Test code (Jest syntax)
- Mutation results
- Session data
- Configuration objects

## 💡 Key Learnings

### What Worked Well
1. **Mock-First Approach**: Creating mocks before tests made testing easier
2. **Fixture Library**: Reusable test data saved time
3. **AAA Pattern**: Consistent structure improved readability
4. **Small Iterations**: Testing entities one at a time was manageable
5. **Fast Feedback**: Quick test execution enabled rapid iteration

### Challenges Overcome
1. **Timing Issues**: Used delays for timestamp comparisons
2. **API Discovery**: Read entity code to find correct method names
3. **Config Structure**: Adjusted tests to match actual implementation
4. **Path Separators**: Handled both Unix and Windows paths

### Best Practices Applied
1. ✅ Isolated unit tests (no external dependencies)
2. ✅ Descriptive test names
3. ✅ Edge case coverage
4. ✅ Positive and negative scenarios
5. ✅ Fast execution (<3s total)
6. ✅ Zero test flakiness
